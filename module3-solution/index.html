                    We always start with an apéritif and an amuse gueule. 
                    These are mostly not served at the dining table but at the coffee table.
                    The apéritif can be anything that sharpens your appetite; champagne, dry cherry, gin tonic, light white wine or even a light beer. 
                    Appetizers are amazing: they keep the animals busy munching before it's quite time for dinner, and give everyone a chance to quit the small talk for a minute
                    and focus on eating. Yet, you don't want an appetizer that requires both hands, let alone a plate and a fork—no one wants to put down their drink for that long.

                <h3 class="text-center">Main Course</h3>
                <p>
                The main dish is usually the heaviest, heartiest, and most complex or substantial dish in a meal. 
                The main ingredient is usually meat, fish or another protein source. 
                It is most often preceded by an appetizer, soup or salad, and followed by a dessert. 
                For those reasons the main course is sometimes referred to as the "meat course".
                In formal dining, a well-planned main course can function as a sort of gastronomic apex or climax.

                Dessert is a course that concludes a meal.
                The course usually consists of sweet foods, such as confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur; 
                however, in the United States it may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items regarded as a separate course elsewhere.
                In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.
                The term dessert can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatins, ice creams, pastries, pies, puddings, sweet soups, and tarts. 
                Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts.

                A drink (or beverage) is a liquid intended for human consumption.
                In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. 
                Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, juice and soft drinks.
                In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years.
                Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as beer and wine, but are made with a 
                sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume.

                    Pastry is a dough of flour, water and shortening (solid fats, including butter) that may be savoury or sweetened. 
                    Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery. The word "pastries" suggests many kinds of baked 
                    products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs. 
                    Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called pastries. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches, croissants, and pasties.
                    Pastry is differentiated from bread by having a higher fat content, which contributes to a flaky or crumbly texture. 
                    A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling.

                <p>
                    A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, placed on or between slices of bread, 
                    or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type.
                    The sandwich began as a portable finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide. The 3rd of November marks the National Sandwich Day
